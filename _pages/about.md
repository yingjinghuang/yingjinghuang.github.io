Hey, I am Yingjing Huang (黄颖菁). 👋

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Cartograpghy and Geographic Information Science at Peking University, China, under the joint supervision of Prof. Lun Wu (邬伦), [Prof. Yu Liu (刘瑜)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xh_lRY4AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Fan Zhang (张帆)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dc1TzLoAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) for one year. I hold a bachelor's and master’s degree from Wuhan University, China, and my advisor was [Prof. Teng Fei (费腾)](https://only4john.github.io/).

My research intersects GIScience and Computer Vision, with a focus on urban visual AI and its implications for guiding urban planning.

Currently, I am working on my doctoral thesis, which focuses on using GeoAI to represent the urban physical environment based on urban imagery, primarily involving remote sensing imagery and street-level imagery. We want to understand how humans transform urban physical spaces and how these spaces, in turn, reflect human daily life.

With my doctoral degree expected in June 2025, I am currently seeking faculty or postdoctoral positions.
